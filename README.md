# libadwaita-web

This will be a vanilla html framework, with custom elements made to compile into usual html elements and supported by vanilla JS and CSS, HTML, JS and CSS will be build to minify, check can-i-use and anything else I find helpful.

it won't be a full fleged website builder but instead a better way to make and compile websites as a template. Initially will have a GTK's adwaita inspired theme (CSS), but will have more themes after the framework is stable and is released.
